### [Assignment 1](./src/components/Assignment1.jsx):

- Create a React component that performs an expensive calculation (finding the factorial) based on user input.

- Utilize the useMemo hook to ensure the calculation is only recomputed when the input changes, not on every render.

### [Assignment 2](./src/components/Assignment2.jsx):

- In this assignment, you will create a component that renders a large list of sentences and includes an input field for filtering these items.

- The goal is to use useMemo to optimize the filtering process, ensuring the list is only re-calculated when necessary (e.g., when the filter criteria changes).
- You will learn something new here, specifically how you have to pass more than one value in the dependency array.
