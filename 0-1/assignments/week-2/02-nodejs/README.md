## Important Notes

1.  If you are unable to understand the request/response of any assignment file or whatever the way it is being tested, you can take a look at its respective test file present in `tests/` directory.

2.  Don't try to make any changes to the test files present in the `tests/` directory.

3.  Don't make any changes to the code already present in files including function/method/class signatures and module exports.

4.  To run individual tests
    ````bash
    npm run test-todoServer
        npm run test-fileServer
        ```
    <br>
    ````
